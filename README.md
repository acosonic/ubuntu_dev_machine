# ubuntu_dev_machine
Bash script to install software and configure various settings for developers

This script is inspired by:
https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup
https://github.com/bkuhlmann/mac_os
https://gist.github.com/bradp/bea76b16d3325f5c47d4


But first by this one
https://gist.github.com/brandonb927/3195465

So, this is script for ubuntu server and desktop machines
which setup stuff like nano syntax colouring (I'm doing this first)...

Virtualmin setup, etc...
